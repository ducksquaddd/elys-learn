# What is EDEN-Boost?

EDEN-Boost is a multiplier token earned while [ELYS](./elys) is staked or [EDEN](./eden) is committed, designed to reward long-term users of the network. It is earned at a 100% APR and can be committed to earn additional EDEN rewards.

## How it Works
- EDEN-Boost acts as a reward multiplier for staking ELYS or committing EDEN
- The boost percentage is calculated as: EDEN-Boost Earned / (ELYS staked + EDEN committed)
- EDEN-Boost can be committed to earn additional EDEN rewards

## Important Notes
- When ELYS is unstaked or EDEN is uncommitted, EDEN-Boost (both committed and uncommitted) is burned proportionally to the amount withdrawn
