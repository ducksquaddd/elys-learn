# What is EDEN?

EDEN is a vesting inflationary reward token that is earned by both stakers and liquidity providers. After earning EDEN, you have several options:

## Claiming EDEN
Once claimed, EDEN is accounted for in your wallet and enables further actions like committing or vesting.

## Committing EDEN
When committed to the network, EDEN earns the same rewards as staked ELYS, allowing users to compound their EDEN rewards. Users can un-commit their EDEN at any time with no unbonding period, after which they can choose to re-commit or vest it.

## Vesting EDEN for ELYS
Users can choose to vest their EDEN for ELYS over a 90-day linear vesting period. During this process:
- The vesting EDEN is burned
- EDEN is locked and vests linearly into ELYS at a 1:1 ratio
- Vesting EDEN does not earn additional rewards
- Vested ELYS automatically deposits into user wallets at predefined block intervals
- Users may cancel vesting at any point during the 90-day period
