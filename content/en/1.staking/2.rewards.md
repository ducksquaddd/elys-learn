# Staking Rewards

Staking ELYS tokens provides multiple revenue streams and benefits. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you can earn:

## Trading Fee Rewards

### Spot Trading Fees
When users trade on the Elys spot markets, a portion of the trading fees is distributed to ELYS stakers in the form of USDC. This creates a direct correlation between platform usage and staker rewards.

### Perpetual Trading Fees
Similar to spot trading, perpetual trading generates fees that are shared with ELYS stakers. These fees provide an additional USDC revenue stream, especially during high trading volume periods.

### Transaction Fees
General platform interactions generate transaction fees that flow back to stakers, creating a steady stream of USDC rewards.

## EDEN Rewards

### EDEN Token Incentives
Stakers earn EDEN tokens as an additional reward for:
- Participating in governance
- Securing the network
- Long-term commitment to the ecosystem

### EDEN-Boost Mechanism

EDEN-Boost is a unique feature that rewards long-term stakers:
- Earned at 100% APR while staking ELYS
- Acts as a multiplier for staking rewards
- Increases rewards over time for committed stakers
- Burns proportionally if ELYS is unstaked

- Rewards can be claimed at any time
