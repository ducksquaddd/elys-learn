# Understanding Governors

## What are Governors?

Governors are a unique type of validator in the Elys network that focus exclusively on governance. Unlike traditional Cosmos validators that participate in block production and consensus, Governors are specialized entities that:
- Participate in governance decisions
- Represent stakers in voting processes
- Help secure the networks governance

## How are Governors Different from Traditional Validators?

Elys operates on a Partial Shared Security (PSS) model where:
- Cosmos Hub validators provide the consensus layer and security
- Governors handle network governance and decision-making
- This separation allows for specialized focus on governance while maintaining robust security based on the Cosmos Hub

## Governor Responsibilities

Governors play several crucial roles:
1. **Governance Participation**
   - Voting on protocol upgrades
   - Participating in parameter changes
   - Representing delegator interests

2. **Community Engagement**
   - Keeping delegators informed about governance proposals
   - Participating in community discussions
   - Contributing to the network's development

## Becoming a Governor

To become a Governor, candidates must:
- Meet some level of technical requirements
- Demonstrate commitment to the network's governance
- Provide value to the network
