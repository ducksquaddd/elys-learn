# What is Staking?

Staking is a process where you lock up Elys tokens to help secure the network in governance and earn rewards. By staking ELYS, you earn multiple reward streams:
- USDC from trading fees (spot, perpetual, and transaction fees)
- EDEN tokens from the incentive program
- EDEN-Boost tokens for long-term staking

## How does it work?
When you stake ELYS tokens, you are delegating your tokens to a Governor. Governors use your staked tokens to vote on your behalf in governance.
